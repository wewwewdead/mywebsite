        <div><p class="p1">I'm <b>JOHN MATHEW LOREN</b>, I'm a self thought web developer.
            My goal for learning programming is to create something fun and share it to the people.
            I first learn python and now I'm learning vanilla javascript with react to the front end and node.js to the backend.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p class="p1">I also like to draw, since I was in highschool. I draw a lot and most of my artworks are portraits of my favorite celebrities yeah my idols.
            Creating things is just my way of escaping to the sad reality of life.
         </p>
        </div>
        
         <!-- <p>My first forray to programming is when I bought a laptop and thinking about how the technology works,
            and ask google questions about programming. Luckily my brother bought a udemy course about python programming "<b>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</b>" by Angela Yu.
            "I recommend it to you if you want to start programming". 
         </p>
         <p>After a few days of writing code, I got hooked to it and reach to the point that I can't sleep thinking about the solution of the bug.
            I spend most of my time after with 7am to 7:30pm work to my full-time job as a factory worker in a metal fabrication company.
         </p>
         <p>Coding is fun to learn, it gives you challenges to solve problems and not only solving problems. It also give you the feeling of like a dopamine rush when you solve the problem.
            Yuh it's not just solving problems, it also gives you the freedom to create, the term "<b>think, build and create</b>".
