        <p>What if I can go back in time. I was thinking about this all the time, it don't really make sense but if I can go back, I would.
            Because when I was 18, I really don't know what do and what I'm doing.
        </p>
        <h2>2017</h2>
        <p>2017 is an interesting year for me:</p>
        <br>
        <p>At that time I was still going to school yeah I'm a college student.
            I was so immature to think that after college my life would be so easy.
            I thought that if you have a degree, you can easily find a stable job.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Let's boil down to the basic fundamentals of truth abouth adulting stage.
            When you are turning 18 you still really immature and still don't understand the real world.
            Your mind still fresh and lacking the experiences especially if you are a privileged person.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>If adulting only involves money then we should ask ourselves, <em class="highlights">WHY WE NEED MONEY?
            HOW TO GET MONEY?
        </em>
        The number one most common answer to those questions is <em class="highlights">FIND A JOB</em>
        securing a job means financial stability.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So if financial stability is the goal, is working 9-5 is the only option? yuh the answer is <em class="highlights">NO</em> and in order to solve that big problem, you need  to work hard when you're still young and become a corporate slave for a decade <em class="highlights">this is probably my easiest way to solve the 9-5 trap</em>.
            If I can go back to 2017 now, I honestly won't go to college instead I will find my purpose in life.
            I should be more focus on enhancing my skills.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My next step is to set goals.
            What will I do after I <em class="highlights">exploit my youth</em>? 
            well if you're curious why I'm talking about <em class="highlights">exploiting our youth</em>
            is that I believe when you work hard as fck when you are still young, the compounding effect of your hardwork will be the biggest impact in your life when you pass age 27.
            Be sure that you do things that you are interested in and find a job that enhance your <em class="highlights">problem solving skills and creativity</em>, 
            Through years of hardwork you will gain experiences that really help you evovle as a human <em class="highlights">(YOU ARE NOW A SKILLED HUMAN BEING EQUIPED WITH KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE.)</em>.
        </p>
        <h2>Save and Invest</h2>
        <p>Back to 2017 I still don't know what is compound interest is.
            If I invest 100$ every month on ETF that mirrors s&p500 on 2017, then my total investment would be 17,000$ today with my initial investment + total monthly contribution, in just 7 years my money grow 50%.
            Compound interest is 1 of the 8 wonders of the world.
            The best technique to invest is to exploit the compounding effect, holding it for more than a decade with an average 8-10% returns will trigger the
            the snowball effect and when you hit the treshold of 100k$, the compound interest will be more doubled and the time horizon to get to 1m$ will be shorter.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>When you do save and invest, you can probably retire from a 9-5 job and escape the soul sucking corporate slave.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><em class="highlights">WORK HARD, SAVE AND INVEST!!!</em></p>
        <h2>Now follow your passion!</h2>
        <p>After exploiting my youth <em class="highlights">"10 years of hardwork"</em> and save and invested my money, I'll be able to live without worrying the money anymore.
        I can now leave the 9-5 job, the goal that I set when I was 18 was achieved.
    The next step is to set another goals.</p>
    <br>
        <p>Next goal is to follow my passion. Creativity, arts, music, writing, poetry, travel etc.
            Most people can'T do this and that's the epitome of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(46, 157, 213);" target="_blank">Maslow Pyramid.</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Now you will asked me it's worth it to sacrifice your youth just to escape the corporate slave?
            The answer is <em class="highlights">YES</em>, being financially free means you're ahead of your peers.
            It's seems very boring life when you work 15 hours a day 6x a week on your 20's, but you'll discover it when you hit age 40.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>When you see people who are working at the age of 35-50 and not able to save and invest money
            and work with a job with no skills required and chilling during their early 20's instead of spending more time in enhancing their skills and gaining experiece.
            You'll feel sorry because they're fucked up, they need to stay in the 9-5 job until they retire and waste their existence just to fulfill their daily needs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead of doing the things you interested in, you are dying working the job you hate just to pay bills for the rest of your life.
            When you realized you're 50 years old and you can't follow your passion anymore. 
            The most important things in our life is our time. Money can't buyback time though you can use money to buy someone else time, and use 
            it for your benefits, <em class="highlights">now that's what happened in corporate world</em>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't let companies buy and used all of your time in this world.</p>
        <p>Find a way to escape the void and be free and creative.</p>
        <br>
